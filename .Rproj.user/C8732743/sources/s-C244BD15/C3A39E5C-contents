## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
fat <- read.csv("Fat_Supply_Quantity_Data.csv")
food_kg <- read.csv("Food_Supply_Quantity_kg_Data.csv")
food_cal <- read.csv("Food_Supply_kcal_Data.csv")
protein <- read.csv("Protein_Supply_Quantity_Data.csv")
protein
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
fat <- fat %>% 
  select(-c(Obesity, Undernourished, Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered, Active, Population, Unit..all.except.Population.))
names <- colnames(fat)
for (i in seq(length(names)-1)) {
  names[i+1] <- paste0(names[i+1], "_fat")
}
colnames(fat) <- names

food_kg <- food_kg %>% 
  select(-c(Obesity, Undernourished, Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered, Active, Population, Unit..all.except.Population.))
names <- colnames(food_kg)
for (i in seq(length(names)-1)) {
  names[i+1] <- paste0(names[i+1], "_food_kg")
}
colnames(food_kg) <- names

protein <- protein %>% 
  select(-c(Obesity, Undernourished, Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered, Active, Population, Unit..all.except.Population.))
names <- colnames(protein)
for (i in seq(length(names)-1)) {
  names[i+1] <- paste0(names[i+1], "_protein")
}
colnames(protein) <- names

merged <- merge(fat, food_kg, by = "Country", all = TRUE)

merged <- merge(merged, protein, by = "Country", all = TRUE)

merged <- merge(merged, food_cal, by = "Country", all = TRUE)

print(merged)

```


```{r}
